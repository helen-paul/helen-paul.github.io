                        <div class="answer">Manor guests should be mindful of the short walk to/from the castle via a gravel path. If it rains this path will get a little muddy, so you might want a second pair of shoes you don't mind getting a bit dirty. There is plenty space at the castle for changing into your fancy shoes.</div>
