                        <p>Thankfully, it looks like the wedding will be able to go ahead as planned without too much compromise. However, COVID is still very much a concern and something that we ask you all to consider throughout the weekend.</p>
                        <p>The venue's team and suppliers are taking all the necessary precautions, and considerations have been made to keep the event as safe as possible.</p>
                        <p>As the rules can change so quickly, we will send another email with the up to date guidelines and restrictions nearer the time. Regardless of that, we kindly ask that everyone brings a mask.</p>
                        <p>We also encourage everyone to take a test no earlier than 48 hours before your arrival at Achnagairn Estate, and to please only attend the wedding if your test is negative.</p>

                        <div class="answer">we highly encourage everyone to only travel to achnagairn if they have had a negative covid-19 test in the previous 2 days.</div>

                    <div class="question-wrapper">
                        <div class="question">Do I need to bring anything, other than my packing essentials and party frock?</div>
                        <div class="answer">Not really!
                            <p>All meals have been arranged, and the self-catering kitchens will be stocked with some snacks, tea and coffee. Feel free to bring anything specific if you wish though! 
                            You are very welcome to bring your own drinks with you, should you want a tipple after (or before!) bar hours.
                            However, you are only allowed to consume your own drinks at the castle while the bars are closed. Licensing laws in Scotland are strict, and fines can be steep for breaking the rules! Oh, and wet and cold weather appropriate clothing is always a good idea in Scotland, just in case!</p>

                        <div class="answer">Once you've arrived at the venue, the only money you may need to spend is at the bar on Saturday. They accept cash and card. 
                            All meals are covered, as well as Friday night drinks.</div>

                        <div class="question">what should I wear?</div>
                        <div class="answer">the wedding day will be semi-formal, and kilts and traditional dress are encouraged, but weâ€™re sure anything you want to wear will be just great. dress up in something you love!
                            <p>the ceremony, meal and dancing will take place indoors, but if the weather allows weâ€™d love to make use of the beautiful garden so itâ€™s probably a good idea to bring something to keep warm and shoes suitable for grass.</p> 
                            <p>manor guests should also be mindful of the short walk to/from the castle via a gravel path. if it rains this path may get a little muddy, so you might want to change into your fancy shoes once you get to the castle.</p>

                        <div class="answer">the ceremony starts at 1.00pm, and our afternoon meal will begin around 4.00pm, so we suggest that you have a big breakfast or a light lunch beforehand. Weâ€™ll provide some pre-ceremony snacks in both the castle and the manors.</div>
