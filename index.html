                        <div class="answer">the highlands in autumn can be a mixed bag: low sun or, rain a-plenty. either way, don't expect it to get too hot. the average temperature in October is about 9c.</div>

                        <div class="answer">each manor has its own parking and there is a dedicated car park for castle guests.</div>

                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>the wedding day will be semi-formal, and kilts and traditional dress are encouraged, but we’re sure anything you want to wear will be just great. dress up in something you love!</p> 
                            <p>the ceremony, meal and dancing will take place indoors, but if the weather allows we’d love to make use of the beautiful garden so it’s probably a good idea to bring something to keep warm and shoes suitable for grass.</p> 
                            <p>manor guests should also be mindful of the short walk to/from the castle via a gravel path. if it rains this path may get a little muddy, so you might want to change into your fancy shoes once you get to the castle.</p>

                        <div class="answer">the ceremony starts at 1.00pm, and our afternoon meal will begin around 4.00pm, so we suggest that you have a big breakfast or a light lunch beforehand. We’ll provide some lunchy bites in the fridges at the castle and in the manors.</div>

                            <p>then you’re in for a treat! there will be plenty of well seasoned dancers around to show you the ropes, but the band’s ‘caller’ will also go through the steps before each dance. wear shoes you can skip and spin in, or just kick them off!</p>
